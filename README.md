## Step 5: Compression Verification

Enabled mod_deflate in Apache to compress HTML, CSS, and JS

Verified using Chrome DevTools:

content-encoding: gzip present in Response Headers

HTML reduced in transfer size, confirming that compression is active.

After enable the compression, the HTML file sent from the server became much smaller in size when transferred, but the actual page content stayed the same. The browser still showed the full HTML after it was uncompressed. This made the page load faster and used less data.
